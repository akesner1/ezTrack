    "The following code was designed in order to implement batch processing of location tracking.  Currently, for this to work, all videos must take the same settings, including the defined regions of interest.  To confirm that regions of interest are consistent across videos, for each video an overlay of the reference frame, the regions of interest and the animal trace are produced.  Moreover, the reference frame is currently required to be generated by taking the median of each individual video.  In addition to saving frame by frame location, distance travelled, and whether the animal is in each ROI in separate csv files, bins can also be defined for summarizing videos (e.g. minute by minute).  All summary information will be saved in a single file.\n",
